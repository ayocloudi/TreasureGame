This Python script is a text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island." The player makes choices at various points in the game, leading to different outcomes. Here's a breakdown of the game's flow:

The game starts with a graphical introduction of the Treasure Island.
It prints a welcome message and explains the mission to find the treasure.
The player is prompted with their first decision - to go left or right at a crossroad.
If the player chooses "left," they face another decision - to wait for a boat or swim across a lake.
If they wait for a boat, they face another choice of selecting a door (red, yellow, or blue) on an island.
Depending on the chosen door, different outcomes occur - finding the treasure, encountering fire, or encountering beasts.
If the player chooses "right" at the beginning or makes other incorrect choices along the way, they face different "Game Over" scenarios.
This code provides a simple interactive experience for the player, where their choices determine the outcome of the game.
